Hello, my name is Edward Yoon. I'm from the Inland Empire, Riverside where its always over 90 degrees. I'm excited to be a part of the SPIS 2017 program. I'm excited to meet new people and interact with computers in a way I haven't before. I've always enjoyed playing on and building computers. In my free time I like to play video games on the PC, or I'll be outside playing tennis.
